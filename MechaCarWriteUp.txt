MPG REGRESSION WRITEUP:

DESCRIPTION:

Using the "MechaCar_mpg" dataset, a multiple linear regression model was designed (reference MechaCarChallenge.RScript) to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. 

BACKGROUND:

The "MechaCar_mpg" dataset contains the results of mpg testing data of 50 potential MechaCar prototypes. For each prototype, multiple metrics were collected, including vehicle length, vehicle weight, 
spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance; each metric represents a design specification that can help identify ideal vehicle performance. 

Linear regressions are a statistical model used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables fitted to the equation of a line. Since each recorded metric in the dataset is an independent variable of interest, a multiple linear regression will be used to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The linear regression predicts future observations by calculating the slope and y-intercept values of the linear model while minimizing the overall distance between each data point and the model. To accomplish this, the linear regression evaluates whether the value of variable "A" can be predicted by a linear model and values from variable "B" by testing the following hypotheses: 

Null Hypothesis: The slope of the linear model is zero. 
Alternative Hypothesis: The slope of the linear model is not zero. 

The null hypothesis can be explained by random chance; if no significant linear relationship can be determined, then each dependent value would be determined by random chance, and our linear model would have a slope of zero.  It is possible to assess the significance of the linear relationship between variables by comparing the p-value to the significance level. A p-value illustrates the likelihood that a similar result will be observed if the data is tested again. The significance level is the predetermined cut off for the hypothesis test; for this assessment, a significance level of 0.05% will be used, meaning there is a 5 in 100 probability of being wrong. Therefore, when the p-value is less than our significance level of 0.05%, there is sufficient evidence that to reject the null hypothesis, indicating the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

Also, how well the linear model can be used to predict future observations can be quantified by the r-squared value. The r-squared value (coefficient of determination) represents how well the linear model approximates future data points. Generally, the r-squared probability metric ranges between 0 and 1, where the closer the r-squared value is to 1, the stronger the correlation. 

RESULTS:

After adding vehicle.length, vehicle.weight, spoiler.angle, AWD (drivetrain), and ground.clearance as independent variables to the multiple linear regression model, the output produced the coefficients for each variable in the linear equation as show below:

mpg = 6.267*vehicle.length + 0.001245*vehicle.weight +  0.06877*spoiler.angle + 3.546*ground.clearance + -3.411*AWD + -104.0

Also, summary statistics were generated to determine which variables provide a significant contribution to the linear model. The summary outputs each variable's p-value, Pr(>|t|), which represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the model. The p-values for each variable is displayed below:

Intercept: 5.08e-08 ***
vehicle.length: 2.60e-12 ***
vehicle.weight: 0.0776   
spoiler.angle: 0.3069    
ground.clearance: 5.21e-08 ***
AWD: 0.1852  

*** The vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept p-values are smaller than our assumed significance of 0.05%. 

The r-squared value of 0.7149 is displayed within the summary statistics as well.

CONCLUSION/ DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:

Indicated by p-values smaller than the significance level of 0.05%, the vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept variables/ coefficients provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. In other words, these variables are statistically significant. Specifically, the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on the mpg. However, the statistical significance of the intercept means other variables and factors are contributing to the variation in mpg and have not been included in the linear regression model. To better predict the mpg of the MechaCar, additional variables such as horsepower will need to be collected and analyzed. 

Also, since the p-values of the vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept are smaller than our significance level of 0.05%, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the slope of our linear model is not zero.

Based on the summary statistics, the r-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that roughly 71.49% of all mpg predictions will be correct using this linear model. Although the model sufficiently predicts the dependent, mpg, variable, the lack of significant variables is evidence of overfitting. Therefore, even though the model performs well with the current dataset, it fails to generalize and predict future data correctly. Again, suggesting that additional variables need to be collected and analyzed. 

SUSPENSION COIL SUMMARY WRITEUP:

Below are the suspension coil summary statistics generated using the "Suspension_Coil" dataset. Refer to MechaCarChallenge.RScript for an additional background as to how the summary statistics table was created. 

Summary Statistics for the Suspension Coil’s Pounds-per-Inch (PSI) Continuous Variable
Mean: 1499.531 PSI
Median: 1499.747 PSI
Variance: 76.235 PSI
Standard Deviation: 8.731 PSI

Based on the above summary statistics, the dataset is normally distributed. A normal distribution is where values farther from the mean of the dataset are less likely to occur than values closer to the mean. Represented by a bell curve, this is demonstrated by the mean and median being approximately the same value. In this case, 1499.531 PSI and 1499.747 PSI, respectively. Also, the dataset has a small variance of 76.235 PSI, indicating that the data points tend to be close to the mean. For each data point in the dataset, subtract the mean and square the result. Then, calculate the average of the squared differences to compute the variance. Thus, the variance can also be described as how far apart the data is spread out from the average (mean) value.  However, since the variance is no longer in the same unit of measurement as the original data due to taking the square, the square root of the variance can be taken to restore the original unit of measure. This is referred to as the standard deviation. The standard deviation of the suspension coil's PSI is 8.731, again indicating the values tend to be closer to the mean. On the contrary, if a large standard deviation were to be observed, the data points would be spread over a wide range of values.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. To verify the current manufacturing data meet this design specification, look to the standard deviation of 8.731 PSI. Since the data is normally distributed, the values will follow the 68-95-99.7 rule, stating that 68.27%, 95.45%, and 99.73% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively. Refer to the ranges of each standard deviation below:

One standard deviation (µ ± σ): 1499.5 ± 8.7 PSI
Two standard deviations (µ ± 2σ): 1499.5 ± 17.4 PSI
Three standard deviations (µ ± 3σ): 1499.5 ± 26.1 PSI

Therefore, the current manufacturing data meets the design specification of not exceeding a variance of 100 PSI. Each data point will not exceed ± 26.1 PSI from the mean.
